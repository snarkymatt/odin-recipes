            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Minestrone is a hearty Italian vegetable soup made with tomato-y broth and pasta or rice. I’ve been
                working hard
                on this recipe and I’m so excited to share it with you.</p>
            <p>
                Minestrone was traditionally made to use up leftover vegetables, so feel free to use any seasonal
                vegetables and
                greens you have on hand. I used potatoes and spinach for the soup you see here, and it was absolutely
                delicious.
            </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
                <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
                <li>2 medium ribs celery, chopped</li>
                <li>¼ cup tomato paste</li>
                <li>2 cups chopped seasonal vegetables (potatoes, yellow squash, zucchini, butternut squash, green beans
                    or peas
                    all work)</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
                <li>1 large can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes, with their liquid (or 2 small 15-ounce cans)</li>
                <li>4 cups (32 ounces) vegetable broth</li>
                <li>2 cups water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>Pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 cup whole grain orecchiette, elbow or small shell pasta</li>
                <li>1 can (15 ounces) Great Northern beans or cannellini beans, rinsed and drained, or 1 ½ cups cooked
                    beans
                </li>
                <li>2 cups baby spinach, chopped kale or chopped collard greens</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
                <li>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for garnishing (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Warm 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or stockpot over medium heat. Once the oil
                    is
                    shimmering, add the chopped onion, carrot, celery, tomato paste and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring
                    often,
                    until the vegetables have softened and the onions are turning translucent, about 7 to 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Add the seasonal vegetables, garlic, oregano and thyme. Cook until fragrant while stirring
                    frequently, about
                    2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour in the diced tomatoes and their juices, broth and water. Add the salt, bay leaves and red
                    pepper
                    flakes. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                <li>Raise heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a boil, then partially cover the pot with the
                    lid,
                    leaving about a 1” gap for steam to escape. Reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer.
                </li>
                <li>Cook for 15 minutes, then remove the lid and add the pasta, beans and greens. Continue simmering,
                    uncovered,
                    for 20 minutes or until the the pasta is cooked al dente and the greens are tender.</li>
                <li>Remove the pot from the heat, then remove the bay leaves. Stir in the lemon juice and remaining
                    tablespoon
                    of olive oil. Taste and season with more salt (I usually add about ¼ teaspoon more) and pepper until
                    the
                    flavors really sing. Garnish bowls of soup with grated Parmesan, if you’d like.</li>
